# AltruismEnvironmentalismCOVIDBehavior

This repository contains the de-identified data and the code to clean and construst the dataset used to develop the paper entitled "Pro-Environmental Attitudes, Altruism, and COVID-19 Risk Management Behavior" by Trisha Shrum, Sarah A. Nowak, Scott C. Merrill, John P. Hanley, Tung-Lin Liu, Eric M. Clark, Asim Zia, and Christopher Koliba. 

To use this code, start with r/master.R and run the file sequentially. The final cleaned dataset is data/segsCovid_2020Survey_FullCleanDataSet.csv. Note the invalidResponse variable which flags low quality data (suspected bots, inaccurate responses, suspected repeats).

Please contact tshrum@uvm.edu if you find any errors or have any questions.
